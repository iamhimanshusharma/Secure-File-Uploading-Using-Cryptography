# Secure File Uploading Using Cryptography
This proposed project is liable to meet the required security needs of the data center of the cloud. AES used for the encryption of file slices takes minimum time and has maximum throughput for encryption and decryption from other symmetric algorithms. The idea of splitting and merging adds on to meet the principle of data security. The hybrid approach when deployed in a cloud environment makes the remote server more secure and thus, helps the cloud providers to fetch more trust of their users.
